Alpha 4.1
- Config file now uses 0 or null (strings) to indicate "use the default"; this permits defaults
to be changed in-code, and still let user preferences work.


Alpha 4.0
Introduce rainfall. 
"SIMPLE" means if the biome's root height is 0 or less (includes some beaches), then low spots will get water.
For this to work, "getAverageGroundLevel()" (which actually returns the minimum spawn height)
must be two blocks or more above the water level. This matches the vanilla overworld -- spawn height 64,
and water at 62.

This model does not have evaporation, and will not refill (most) surface lakes
